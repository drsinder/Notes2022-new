Most of the controllers in the folder are called by the shared project
DAL.  These are NOT:  Those beginning with Api, OidcConfigurationController,
and ImageController.

These provide access to functional sets of data, NOT to primitive 
data (Tables/Rows).

The DAL provides a place to isolate the calls which depend on hard coded
strings rather than refrences to classes/object.  It also provide a 
place to "Package" some of the input data.

Generally speaking the constructors grab:

        // access to data
        private readonly NotesDbContext _db;
        // access to the user data instance
        private readonly UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;
        // helper to get userid
        private readonly IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor;

The last two are usually used for access checking of some kind.

In in general I'd like to do most of the work in the static classes in
the Manager folder.  I've not followed through on that as well
as I should.  Area for later work!
